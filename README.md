## Architecture

We solve data mapping and management of personal data challenges in 3 modules:


### EXTRACT

Extract Structured Personal Data in Databases, CRM, ERP, and proprietary systems. Also works with unstructured data, such as, emails, PDFs, Word, and Excel.

The Pontus Vision platform extracts structured and unstructured data in an automated manner and without interference on daily operations. The solution does not require changes to the customers’ systems, being able to receive large volumes of data from several corporate systems. Connectors for systems not yet supported are easily implemented.

Structured Data: Databases, CRM, ERP and proprietary systems.
Unstructured Data: emails, Microsoft Office documents, PDF files, and others.



### TRACK

Maps all the data from the Extract module, identifying natural persons with as little data as possible, scalable to trillions of records.

Our solution maps data by tracking all data sources from the Extract stage, identifying customer data with as little information as possible, using graph databases and natural language processing technologies, supporting trillions of records.

Scalability is extremely important as the number of data on natural persons grows daily, with each customer or staff interaction generating new data.

Pontus Vision is based on the POLE (Person, Object, Location, Event) data model to Track data. This is a model used by the UK Government to associate data with individuals. The POLE model creates relationships between People, Objects, Locations and Events, forming the basis of a robust intelligence structure.



### COMPLY

Gathers links to all personal data within an organization, with graphical or textual reports, using a scoring system based on the ICO’s 12 steps to GDPR compliance.

All data is consolidated in a dashboard, for graphical or textual visualization.

The solution gathers links to all personal data within an organization, with graphical or textual reports, using a scoring system based on the ICO’s 12 steps to GDPR compliance.

All forms and reports are managed in real time, showing the areas of the organization that have personal data.
